**Coal Gangue Classification with YOLOv8.2.24 - Python Code Analysis** 

* This script demonstrates how to train and use a YOLOv8 model for classifying coal and gangue in images. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Importing libraries:
   
* numpy: Used for numerical computations.
* pandas: (Not used in this script) Potentially for data manipulation.
* os: Used for interacting with the operating system (file paths).
* from ultralytics import YOLO: Imports the YOLO class from the ultralytics library for object detection and classification.
* 
2. Loading a pre-trained model:

* model = YOLO("yolov8n-cls.pt")  # load a pretrained model
  * This line loads a pre-trained YOLOv8n model named "yolov8n-cls.pt" specifically configured for classification (denoted by "cls").

3. Training the model:

* results = model.train(data="C:\coal_gangue", epochs=10, imgsz=64)
  * model.train: This method trains the model on the provided data.
  * data="C:\coal_gangue": Specifies the directory containing the training images.
  * epochs=10: Number of training epochs (iterations).
  * imgsz=64: Resizes training images to 64x64 pixels.
    
4. Notice about Update:

New https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/8.2.26 available  Update with 'pip install -U ultralytics'
This line informs you that a newer version (8.2.26) of the ultralytics library is available. You can update it using pip install -U ultralytics. However, the code continues using version 8.2.24.

5. Overriding model configuration:

* The script shows how many classes the pre-trained model was configured for (likely 1000) and overrides it to 2 classes (coal and gangue) based on your data.

6. Training summary:

* The code outputs a detailed summary of the training process, including:
  * Model layers and parameters
  * Transferred weights
  * Training loss and accuracy
  * Training time per epoch

7. Validation:

The script performs validation on the best weights saved during training and reports the accuracy on the validation data.

8. Loading a custom model:

* model = YOLO(r"C:\Users\Lenovo\runs\classify\train10\weights\last.pt")
  * This line loads the model trained on your coal-gangue data from the specified path.

9. Prediction:

* results = model(r"C:\coal_gangue\train\coal\IR000033.bmp")  # predict on a coal image
  * The model predicts the class (coal or gangue) and its confidence score for a given image path.

10. Extracting results:

* The script demonstrates how to access various information from the prediction results object, including:
  * Predicted class names
  * Confidence scores
  * Processing speeds
    
11. Predicting on a different image:

The script showcases prediction on a gangue image using the same approach.
